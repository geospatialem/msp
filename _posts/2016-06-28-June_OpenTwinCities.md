**Open data + CartoDB = Map-stravaganza!**

This month, we'll be holding a joint meeting with [Open Twin Cities](http://www.meetup.com/OpenTwinCities) to bring together the power of open data with the visual thrill of maps!  Come ready to learn about open data, maps, and how you can combine the two to make exciting visualizations.  

The plan:

1. Maptime MSP will demo CartoDB, a powerful but easy-to-use mapping tool.
2. Open Twin Cities will demo some of the Minnesota open data portals.
3. We'll break up into teams and start mapping some of our favorite open data sets together.
4. At the end of the meetup, we'll demo our maps and choose our favorites! (Prizes may be involved.)

_Parking options:_  
* 19th Ave Ramp ($7 for 2-3 hours);
