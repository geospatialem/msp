We will start off with short talks (~10 min) about something that you are working on, and then the remainder of the meeting will be time to discuss or collaborate on projects.

Presentations and projects are not expected to be polished, just an introduction to something that you are working on.  People can present for various reasons (and you don't have to specify yours..):

* To get feedback / critique  
* To ask for help or assistance on part of a project  
* To find collaborators for a project  
* To show others work that you are proud of  

Please email [david.fawcett@gmail.com](mailto:david.fawcett@gmail.com) if you are interested in giving a quick talk.  We are looking for any map-related projects and really want to see examples of what you, Maptime MSP members are working on.

Everyone is welcome.  No matter what your experience level is, if you are interested in maps, this is the group for you.  

Pizza will be provided by [CARTO](http://carto.com)!
