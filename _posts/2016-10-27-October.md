This month we'll have an informal get together to celebrate our two year anniversary during the [Minnesota GIS/LIS Conference](http://mngislis.org/2016)'s annual conference in Duluth to chat about our love of maps among fellow map lovers!

Join us for the first time or join us again! We want **YOU** to tell us what you'd like to see at future events, such as [CARTO](http://carto.com) visualizations, Open Street Map, our favorite maps, and much more!
