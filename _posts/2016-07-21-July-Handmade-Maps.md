**Maps + Art = Awesome!**

Join us in taking on the creative side of maps. Be prepared to learn about everything from conceptualizing a hand made map, materials, processes, and tips and tricks.

[Jacqueline Kovarik](http://www.twitter.com/cartojacqueline) will give an overview of how she makes her handmade, watercolor maps followed by methods that other cartographers use in other types of handcrafted mapping.

Following the presentation, Jacqueline will lead a map art project that each attendee can participate in. At the end of the session, we'll each have a piece of map art to take home!

Please feel free to bring a map that you've created (digitally or otherwise) to use in the map art project (make sure it's one you feel comfortable folding and cutting).

We will have pizza and beverages, courtesy of CARTO. As always, beginners are welcome!
