We will meet for pizza (thanks CartoDB! :smile:), and presentations in the Wilson Library sub-basement, room S30B.

After the presentations, Ryan Mattke will give us a tour of the Borchert Map Library (also in the sub-basement, room S76). Everyone is welcome to bring cameras/phones to take pictures of the space and/or the maps.

If we have enough time, the library has a large format scanner on-site. Ryan will help us scan maps. If you'd like to scan a map, or maps, please bring a flash drive along!
